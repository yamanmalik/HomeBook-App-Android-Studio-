# HomeBook App
This repository contains the files for one of my projects in one of my courses (Intro. to Soft. Eng.)
The purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to the world of Android development, as well as how to
use Android Studio/ it's proper syntax. We learned how to create buttons and link them to new activities. 
App layout can be seen  by opening the folder in Android Studio.
